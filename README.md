University Clustering Project Shared Space
==========================================

Contains a set of Jupyter notebooks that have some details on cleaning up a cut and paste (examples given) of THES
rankings data, plus some code for normalising university identities to GRID IDs. Does not include the grid json file
which should be updated with a fresh example of the GRID data dump.
