    "Simple processing of the text files that result from copying and pasting the tables from the THES rankings. There are two tabs in the table, one gives rankings alongside some demographic information. The other other gives the elements that make up the score.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tab was copy-pasted into a text file (THES_2016-17_ranks.txt and THES_2016-17_scores.txt) which have some idiosyncratic formatting. The goal here is to bring them into a single csv file that has been normalised to a standardised set of countries and ultimately to GRID IDs."
